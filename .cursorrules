# Peer Review Workflow Rules
# Version: 1.0

This project uses a multi-model peer review workflow to stress-test plans before execution.

## File Conventions

- **Plans:** `.cursor/archive/plan_<topic>.md`
- **Reviews:** `.cursor/archive/reviews_<topic>_<model>_<timestamp>.md`
- **Updated plans:** `.cursor/archive/plan_<topic>_v2.md`

## Workflow

1. **Plan** — Primary model creates a plan in `.cursor/archive/plan_<topic>.md`
2. **Review** — User triggers peer review via multi-model chat (see `.cursor/prompts/peer_review_prompt.md`)
3. **Synthesize** — User tells primary model to read `reviews_<topic>_*.md` files and triage feedback
4. **Execute** — Implement the refined plan

## When to Peer Review

- ✅ **YES:** High-risk changes, architectural decisions, uncertainty about approach
- ❌ **NO:** Bug fixes, styling tweaks, simple CRUD operations

## Prompts

All workflow prompts are in `.cursor/prompts/peer_review_prompt.md`:
- Planning prompt (creates plan file)
- Review prompt (for multi-model reviewers)
- Synthesis prompt (triages feedback)

## Compatibility with Planner/Executor

This workflow coexists with Planner/Executor rules. The review prompt explicitly tells reviewer models to bypass Planner/Executor mode selection and execute the review directly.
